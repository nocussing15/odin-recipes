        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
        <p>Pho is a Vietnamese dish best served hot. A soup consiting of bone broth, rice noodles, thinly cut beef, green onions, some beef balls, and other veggies.
            I personally prefer adding in chili oil, sriracha, and hoisin sauce. You can generally opt for thick or thin rice noodles. Once served, never wait too long to eat
            your pho or risk your noodles becoming soggy.

            <li><span>&#188</span> thinly sliced onions</li>

            <li>Table Veggies: Fresh mint, thai basil, bean sprouts, lime wedges, chilies, hoisin sauce, srirachi, and chili sauce </li>
        </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place beef bones in a stockpot (10-quart or larger). Cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat for 3 to 5 minutes. As the bones boil, scum and foam will float to the top. Drain the bones, rinse with warm water, and scrub the stockpot clean. Return bones to the pot and add 6 quarts of cold water.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven broiler to high. Line a baking sheet with foil. Place onion quarters and halved ginger on the baking sheet and broil for 10 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally until nicely charred.</li>
            <li>Place cinnamon, coriander, fennel, star anise, cloves, and cardamom pod in a dry frying pan over low heat. Toast for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant. Transfer the spices to a muslin bag or cheesecloth and seal with twine.</li>
            <li>Bring the stockpot to a boil, then reduce heat to a gentle simmer. Add the charred onions, ginger, spice bag, salt, fish sauce, and rock sugar. Gently simmer uncovered for 3 hours, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface.</li>
            <li>Use tongs to remove bones, onions, and ginger. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer. To remove the fat, skim it off with a spoon or refrigerate the broth overnight (the fridge solidifies the fat at the top, which is easy to remove in the morning).</li>
            <li>Place the strained broth into a stockpot and simmer over medium-low heat while you prepare the noodles.</li>
            <li>To prepare the noodles for cooking, place dried pho noodles in a bowl and cover with hot water. Soak for 15 to 20 minutes or until they are soft and opaque. If you have fresh noodles, do not cover them with hot water. Add them to a colander and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Add noodles and cook briefly (about 10 seconds) until they soften. Drain the noodles and divide them evenly between serving bowls, filling each bowl about 1/3 of the way.</li>
            <li>Arrange slices of raw meat over the noodles in each bowl. Carefully ladle the very hot broth over the meat, cooking it gently. Top with onion slices and cilantro. Serve with your favorite pho toppings at the table.</li>
        </ol>
